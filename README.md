# Odin Recipes (Thai Food Edition)

## Description

This project is a Thai food edition of the Odin Recipes project, featuring three
well-known Thai dishes: Pad Thai, Tom Yum Kung, and Som Tum Plu Pla Ra.

The main goal of this project is to strengthen my frontend fundamentals using
HTML and CSS. Although the original Odin Recipes project only requires HTML,
I intentionally added CSS to practice layout design and styling.

The website is not fully responsive, but it supports horizontal resizing by
using responsive units such as `rem` for most elements. This project helped me
become more familiar with web development concepts, as my prior experience is
mainly in competitive programming rather than frontend development.

## What I Learned

- Splitting the screen into a 40–60 layout using viewport width (`vw`) instead of Flexbox
- Arranging elements and buttons (still improving consistency and intuition)
- Becoming more comfortable with fine-grained spacing using padding and margin
- Using CSS Grid for the ingredient list to improve space efficiency and readability
- Applying good practices for text sizing with `clamp()` and proper `line-height`
- Using shadows to visually separate and emphasize the main content area
